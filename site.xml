		<p>Lauren Massari currently works as a Multimedia Designer for the <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/">Institute for Advanced Technology in the
				Humanities</a>, located at the University of Virginia. She primarily works on 3D architectural visualization. Projects she has worked on include
			Historic Fort Snelling, Virtual Williamsburg, and Digital Montpelier.</p>

		<p>Lauren received a Master of Architecture from the University at Buffalo in May 2012. Her concentration was in <a
				href="http://idea.ap.buffalo.edu//idg/work/index.asp">Inclusive Design</a>, a multidisciplinary field that uses the Seven Principles of
			Universal Design to evaluate and create products and environments that promote health, well-being, and social participation for a wider range of
			users. Lauren received an award for Design Excellence in Inclusive Design from the School of Architecture and Planning at University at Buffalo in
			2012, as well as an AIA Certificate of Merit for excellence in the study of architecture.</p>

		<p>Lauren received a Bachelor of Architectural History with a minor in art history from the University of Virginia in 2009. Her thesis focused on the
			theater design firm of Rapp &amp; Rapp and how it responded to vernacular architecture when designing small-town theaters, using the theaters in
			Charlottesville, Virginia and Peekskill, New York as case studies.</p>

		<p>The goal of this project was to come up with a design that would attract residents and visitors alike to Downtown Buffalo as part of a waterfront
			revitalization project. The aquarium program was to include an IMAX theater, café, and parking area. Beyond the basic program requirements, part of
			my design concept was to transform the site into a transportation hub, concentrating vehicular, pedestrian, metro, and boat traffic in a central
			location, providing information about the aquarium and Buffalo, and encouraging visitors to disperse across the city.</p>

		<p>The goal for comprehensive studio was to design a mixed-use project in Downtown Buffalo for a specific community, focusing on details such as
			structure, life safety, and mechanical systems. My chosen community was cirque nouveau performers, who would live in the twenty-four residence units
			and practice and perform in the ellipsoid theater that opens onto a busy Buffalo street. The main design challenge of this project was meeting the
			program requirements of twenty-four units, a public program, and a parking garage that could accommodate large trucks on a relatively small urban
			site.</p>

		<p>The first month of this study abroad program was spent travelling around the Irish Coast, spending a few days each in the cities of Dublin, Cork,
			Killarney, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Derry, and Belfast, learning about the culture, history, and landscape of each area. During this month of
			travel, we studied the works of Irish authors and poets and made travel-sized models based on our experiences in the cities. The second half of the
			trip was spent back in Dublin, where we researched Irish architectural typologies and used studio space at University College Dublin to design four
			houses that reflected four different parts of the country.</p>

		<p>This semester consisted of two projects, the first of which was to design a disaster relief toilet for the Marine A grain elevator located just south
			of Downtown Buffalo. The design had to accommodate the needs of ourselves and an imaginary client, and, among other requirements, had to be easily
			transportable and simple to construct. For the <a href="http://idea.ap.buffalo.edu//idg/work/fall2011/lauren_massari/massari_1.asp">second design
				project</a>, we reimagined the Marine A grain elevator as an event destination and designed permanent public restrooms, largely based on
			research into ergonomics and precedents as well as information obtained from a focus group. Designing permanent facilities also enabled us to focus
			more on the users’ multisensory experiences within the space and to go beyond the expectations of a public restroom.</p>

		<p>For this Inclusive Design studio, each student came up with a design proposal for a <a
				href="http://idea.ap.buffalo.edu//idg/work/Spring2012/lauren_massari/massari_1.asp">new residence hall</a> on University at Buffalo’s North
			Campus as part of UB’s recent comprehensive physical plan.</p>
		<p>Before beginning the design process, the studio was tasked with finding appropriate precedents in architecture periodicals. The focus was on
			larger-scale projects that incorporated any combination of study, classroom, commercial, and recreational facilities into residential buildings or
			complexes, creating living-learning environments for students. The studio also conducted literature reviews to discern what scientific research has
			discovered about the influence of the physical environment on residence hall occupants. As part of this initial research, the studio also went on
			tours of three vastly different on-campus housing options available to University at Buffalo undergraduates; Greiner Hall, Ellicott Complex, and
			Governors Complex.</p>
		<p>To complement what was learned from the scientific studies, the studio also conducted focus groups with residents of the Governors Complex on UB’s
			North Campus. As the Inclusive Design research group, the studio is focused on the users of buildings and strives to design to improve human
			performance, health and wellness, and social participation. As occupants of on-campus housing, these students provided valuable information about
			what works and what needs improvement in their environment, and their concerns were addressed in our design proposals.</p>
		<p>The knowledge gathered from precedent studies, tours, literature, and focus groups was synthesized into a design that meets both the studio’s goals
			of Inclusive Design and the university’s expectations for a living-learning environment for UB’s comprehensive physical plan.</p>
